The Movie Recommendation System is an end-to-end project that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and search queries. This system utilizes a collaborative and content based filtering approach to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy, by analyzing their historical preferences as well as the preferences of similar users. Whether you're a movie enthusiast looking for your next favorite film or a casual viewer seeking something new, this system aims to enhance your movie-watching experience.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The project offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface where users can easily search for movies and receive personalized recommendations.

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for movies using keywords, titles, genres, or any relevant information. The system provides real-time suggestions as the user types, making the search process efficient and interactive.

- **Personalized Recommendations:** By analyzing the user's historical movie preferences and ratings, the system generates tailored movie recommendations. It identifies similar users and suggests movies that they enjoyed but the current user hasn't seen yet.
